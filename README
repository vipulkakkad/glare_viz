A: Running this puzzle:

1) Double-click stage1.html.
This will run the first stage, where all gears start off the board, and they can be placed on the board.
They can move on when they've reached the stage where they read off the first instruction for how much to turn.

2) Double-click stage2.html
Now, all gears are placed on the board, and the game is in the mode that they will all turn together.
They can scroll to turn the large wheel and extract the four clues that lead to the final answer.
